To start a new project (package with Cargo)
`cargo new project_name --bin`
Now you have a directory with project name which include a .toml file and src
directory.
Use `cargo build` and `cargo run` to build&run the project.

If ready for release, use `cargo build --release` to compile with optimizations.
